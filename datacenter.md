Energy recycling is the recovery of energy that would normally be wasted in industrial 
processes by flaring, exhausting to the atmosphere or operating low efficiency equipment, 
and converting it into electricity or thermal energy (steam or heated water)[@recycleEnergy-sp20-516-224].

### Forms of Energy Recycling

* Electric Turbo Compound(ETC)
    * A turbine is placed at the exhaust of generator to harvest waste energy and convert it into 
      electrical power.  
* Waste Heat Recovery
    * Heat lost in the form of exhaust gases, cooling water, and heat lost from hot equipment surfaces 
      and heated products is recovered to improve energy production.
* Combined Heat and Power(CHP)
    * The concurrent production of electricity or mechanical power and useful thermal energy 
      (heating and/or cooling) from a single source of energy.

### Google's effort towards renewable energy

Google is using renewable energy by following circular economy model as compared to linear one. In 
today's most prevalent linear model, a product is manufactured, shipped to an end user and then ends
up in trash. This is not a sustainable model and it creates excessive waste.

### Circular Economy Practice At Google

A circular economy model is restorative and regenerative as shown in @fig:Google-Circular-Economy. 
In such model, products are created to be easily refurbished, repaired, reused and recycled.

It is based in three principles.

* Principle 1: Preserve and Enhance Natural Capital.
* Principle 2: Optimise resource yields by circulating products, components and materials in use 
  at the highest utility at all times.
* Principle 3: Foster system effectiveness by revealing and designing out negative externalities.

#### Programs Under Circular Economy

* Maintain/Prolong
    * Focus at repair process to enable longer life expectancy of servers.
* Refurbish/Re-manufacture
    * Dismantling of reusable component of decommissioned servers so that these components can be
      reused.
* Reuse/Redistribute
    * Redistribution of any excess component inventory.
* Recycle
    * Maximizes the recycling of all data center material, including the electronic equipments. 

In 2015, 19% of servers Google deployed were re-manufactured machines. 

In 2016, 22% of the components Google used for machine upgrades were refurbished inventory.

In 2016, 36% of servers Google deployed were re-manufactured machines. Server upgrades and repairs also 
tap the refurbished inventory pool.

In 2017, over 2.1 million units were resold by Google and productively reused by other organizations 
around the world.

In 2016, six of Googleâ€™s 14 data centers reaching 100% landfill diversion rate.

On September 4, 2018, Microsoft South Central US datacenter outage took down a number of cloud services.
A lot of cloud services where impacted as shown in @fig:microsoft_outage.

Outage happened due to lightning which strikes storage servers and damaged it. It took almost 21 hours 
to recover from damage and get back to usual business.
